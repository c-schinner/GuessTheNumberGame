# Guess the Number Game
Welcome to the Guess the Number game, where you'll put your guessing skills to the test! Try to guess the secret number chosen by the computer and see if you can figure it out within 8 attempts.

# How to Play
Run the program using a Python interpreter.

You'll be prompted to enter your name.

Once you enter your name, the game will start, and you'll have 8 attempts to guess the secret number.

The secret number is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

After each guess, the program will provide you with a hint to guide your next guess.

If your guess is too high, the program will tell you to try a lower number.

If your guess is too low, the program will tell you to try a higher number.

Keep making guesses until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
