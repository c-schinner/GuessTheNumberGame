# GuessTheNumberGame

This game took more skill to complete, using the randint module to get a randomly generated number for the computer to use.
Having the user try to guess the correct number within 8 tries, or they lose the game.
Implementing while loops and if/elif statements to keep the user guessing until they guess correct or lose the game.
