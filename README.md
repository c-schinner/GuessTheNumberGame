Guess the number game

This Guess the Number game, taught me how to use while loops to add continuation of a game with a set amount of lives for the user to guess the computers number correctly.
Also using the randint function from random to have the computer randomly generate a number between 1-100
It was a great learning experience and fun to work on.
